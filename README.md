# KillProcesses
Two simple VBScripts that read a a list of process names and then terminate them.
Note: KillProcesses_PSKill.vbs requires PSKill.exe which you can download here:
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/pskill.aspx

Extract PSKill.exe from the download, put it in the same directory as the scripts.
After that, run it once so you can accept the agreement.
